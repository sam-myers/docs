## Create an AWS SNS resource using `@pulumi/aws`

The `@pulumi/aws` library enables fine-grained control over the AWS SNS resource meaning it can be coded, deployed, and managed entirely in code.

```javascript
const aws = require("@pulumi/aws");

const topic = new aws.sns.Topic("mytopic");

const topicSubscription = new aws.sns.TopicSubscription("mytopicsubscription", {
    topic: topic,
    protocol: "sqs",
    endpoint: queue.arn
});
```
